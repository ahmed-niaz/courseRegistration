# CourseRegistration

The landing page for course registration is exclusively optimized for mobile devices and offers complete functionality. It features a list of available courses from which users can select their desired options. However, there are certain limitations to note: users are allotted only 21 credits, and they can select only one course at a time. Additionally, prompts will appear if a user attempts to add the same course twice or exceeds the 21-credit limit.
